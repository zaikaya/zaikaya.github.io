Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 28, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how U-2200 (“the App”), developed by Prat Tana (“we,” “us,” or “our”), handles user information.

U-2200 is designed for privacy-sensitive users. Protecting your privacy is a core feature of the App.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect personal data.

The App:
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking technologies
- Does not access the internet or transmit data off the device
- Does not use third-party SDKs that collect data

All journal entries and content are stored locally on your device only.

2. Local Storage

All journal data is stored exclusively on your device using a local database.

We do not have access to your data, and your data is never transmitted to us or to any third party.

3. Data Export

The App allows you to export your journal entries (for example, as a CSV file) at your request.

Exported files:
- Are created only when you initiate an export
- Are saved to a location you choose on your device
- Are not accessed, transmitted, or collected by the developer

Once exported, these files are outside the control of the App.

4. Data Deletion

Deleting the App will remove all journal data stored within the App from your device.

Any files you exported outside of the App (such as CSV files) are not managed by the App and will not be deleted automatically when the App is removed.

5. Children’s Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted with an updated “Last updated” date.
