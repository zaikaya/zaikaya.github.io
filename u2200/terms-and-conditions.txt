Terms & Conditions

Last updated: January 28, 2026

These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the U-2200 mobile application (the “App”), developed by Prat Tana (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

1. The App

U-2200 is a personal journaling application designed for privacy-sensitive users.

The App:
- Stores all journal entries locally on the user’s device
- Does not collect, transmit, share, or process personal data
- Does not make any network calls
- Does not use analytics, advertising, tracking, or third-party SDKs

2. Privacy & Data

Your privacy is a core feature of the App.

- All journal data remains entirely on the user’s device
- We do not have access to your journal entries
- No user data is collected or shared

Deleting the App will remove all journal data stored within the App from the device. Any files exported by the user outside of the App (such as CSV files) are not managed by the App and will not be deleted automatically.

For additional details, please refer to the App’s Privacy Policy, if provided.

3. License

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.

For Apple devices, this license is valid only for use on Apple-branded products that you own or control, and as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

4. User Responsibilities

You are responsible for:
- Maintaining access to your device
- Securing your device and its contents
- Creating backups of your data, if desired

We are not responsible for data loss resulting from device failure, operating system updates, app deletion, or user actions.

5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
- Use the App in violation of any applicable local, state, national, or international laws

The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” with all faults, without warranty of any kind.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Prat Tana shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to data loss, arising out of or related to your use of the App.
