    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the U-2200 mobile application (the “App”), developed by Prat Tana (“we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. The App</h2>
    <p>U-2200 is a personal journaling application designed for privacy-sensitive users.</p>
    <p>The App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stores all journal entries locally on the user’s device</li>
        <li>Does not collect, transmit, share, or process personal data</li>
        <li>Does not make any network calls</li>
        <li>Does not use analytics, advertising, tracking, or third-party SDKs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is a core feature of the App.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All journal data remains entirely on the user’s device</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your journal entries</li>
        <li>No user data is collected or shared</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Deleting the App will remove all journal data stored within the App from the device. Any files exported by the user outside of the App (such as CSV files) are not managed by the App and will not be deleted automatically.</p>
    <p>For additional details, please refer to the App’s Privacy Policy, if provided.</p>

    <h2>3. License</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>
